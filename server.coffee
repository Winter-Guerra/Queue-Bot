# Roller Coaster Queuing Program.
# By Winter Guerra. August 20th, 2014. CC-BY-SA 3.0.

# This program will advertise a phone number that people can text with their name.
# Once received, the name and number is entered into a FIFO queue.
# Every few minutes, the roller coaster operator should text the number with "next" to get the queue to move along.
# The program will respond to the operator with an updated list truncated to 5 people.
# Then, the program will respond to the 3 people in the front of the FIFO queue.
